# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of the project is to pitch an investment in cryptocurrency to an accounting firm. We are provided witha dataset of crytocurrencies, and we use data selection, data processing and data transformation to clean the data and make predictions based off the data. The task is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. Once the grouping is done, we use data visualizations so we can present this to the accounting firm.

## Results: 
* We used a clustering algorith to group the crytocurrencies.
* A 3D Scatter plot was created to display the data.

## Summary: 
Machine learning was used to complete this project. It was broken down into 4 parts.
* Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
* Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
* Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
* Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
